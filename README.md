## About Me

I'm a pre-university student entering college, driven by curiosity and a strong interest in building tools that solve practical problems. I enjoy exploring how things work at a low level â€” from scripting and automation to system internals and emulation.

Most of my projects are in Python and focus on automation, application control, and system-level experimentation. I'm currently exploring emulator development.
